Read chapters 1 and 2 in GTG. <br><br>

Work on chapter problems for chapters 1 and 2 (see above the table for the listing). <br><br>


If you do not have them already, install Java JDK 8 and Eclipse (the latest version is Neon). You must have Java JDK version 7 or 8. The prior version may lead to problems with your submissions and potential zero grade on projects. To see which version of JDK is installed on your machine:
* in Eclipse: _Window → Preferences → Java → Installed JRE's_
* in a terminal: _javac -version_ should show "javac 1.8...." or "javac 1.7..."

Read the Code conventions document.
